## v0.7.0 - 2026-07-22

OpenTag 0.7.0 completes the Phase 1 completion-governance vertical slice. A
successful executor result is now distinct from evidence-backed completion:
OpenTag can persist a work loop, evaluate its configured contract against
current-cycle evidence, explain blockers, and accept narrowly scoped human
waivers. This is a coordinated release of all 16 public packages, including
`@opentag/governance` as a first-class member of the package family.

### Added

- Additive `WorkThread`, `CompletionContract`, `CompletionGateResult`,
  `CompletionAssessment`, and `HumanEscalation` protocol schemas and JSON Schema
  exports in `@opentag/core`.
- Durable work-thread, contract, assessment, escalation, waiver, evidence, and
  delivery records in `@opentag/store`, including assessment history and
  completion metrics.
- The public `@opentag/governance` package, with a deterministic evaluator and
  a small command/query surface for reassessment, evidence ingestion, and
  bounded completion waivers.
- GitHub pull-request, required-check, head-SHA, and merge evidence
  normalization, plus dispatcher correlation from verified webhook facts to
  the current work thread.
- CLI completion explanation and pairing-authenticated waiver commands. Waivers
  are limited to selected gates in the current contract, carry an expiry, and
  remain attributable to a human actor.
- A replay fixture and governance-matrix scenario covering the GitHub
  completion path from executor success through current-head checks, merge
  evidence, reassessment, source-thread projection, and restart recovery.

### Changed

- Completion is evaluated from the latest run attached to a work thread. Run
  artifacts and receipts from older delivery epochs cannot satisfy the current
  contract, and external evidence must be observed during the current epoch.
- Dispatcher reassessment is idempotent and replay-safe across duplicate
  result/evidence delivery and process restarts. Conflicting or stale inputs
  fail closed instead of silently advancing completion.
- Local CLI startup accepts strict GitHub completion policies and forwards them
  to the dispatcher runtime, closing the configuration path needed for a real
  webhook-to-assessment run.
- Hermes ACP readiness allows the adapter's observed startup latency instead of
  inheriting the generic three-second probe deadline.
- Package discovery, packed-install validation, and release documentation now
  cover the complete 16-package publication set.

### Release validation note

The repository fixtures and release gates cover the deterministic and packaged
paths. A registry-installed, credentialed live GitHub chain must still pass
before `0.7.0` is promoted from `next` to `latest`; this changelog does not claim
that live proof in advance.

## v0.6.0 - 2026-07-16

OpenTag 0.6.0 moves every built-in coding agent onto the Generic ACP host,
adds Cursor, OpenCode, and OpenClaw as built-in executors, and hardens ACP
workspace isolation, cancellation evidence, source-thread summaries, and the
coordinated npm release gate. It is a coordinated release of all 15 public
packages and contains breaking Runner, daemon-configuration, and Node.js
support changes described below.

### Added

- Built-in Generic ACP definitions for Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode,
  Hermes, and OpenClaw. Registry-backed Codex, Claude Code, and OpenCode
  launchers are pinned to `@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp@1.1.2`,
  `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp@0.59.0`, and
  `opencode-ai@1.18.1`, while installed Cursor, Hermes, and OpenClaw commands
  reuse their existing local authentication and profiles.
- Public `@opentag/runner` helpers for registry-driven ACP integrations:
  `createAcpAgentExecutor`, `createAcpAgentManifest`,
  `builtInAcpAgentDefinitions`, `builtInAcpAgentManifests`, and
  `createBuiltInAcpExecutors`.
- Compact custom ACP launch definitions under `daemon.agents`, including
  command, arguments, relative working directory, session mode, readiness
  timeout, profile capability, cancellation capability, and the required
  workspace-cwd conformance declaration.
- Streaming ACP progress and cancellation support for the built-in agents that
  can prove cancellation, plus a shared conformance harness covering
  repository worktrees, scratch workspaces, session cwd, completion, refusal,
  and cancellation behavior.
- A fail-closed OpenClaw ACP conformance gate. OpenClaw remains declared with
  `supportsCancel: false` until its Gateway can prove that cancelling a Run
  terminates the active tool process as well as the ACP session. Stock
  OpenClaw 2026.7.1 passes worktree, scratch, and disposable-session checks but
  can let a Gateway-owned shell subprocess finish after ACP cancellation, so
  cancellation remains explicitly best effort.
- Built-in CLI discovery and capability reporting for Cursor, OpenCode, and
  OpenClaw alongside Codex, Claude Code, Hermes, and Echo.

### Changed

- Codex, Claude Code, and Hermes no longer use dedicated direct executor
  adapters. The Local Runtime now launches all built-in coding agents through
  the same Generic ACP executor and OpenTag-owned worktree or scratch
  isolation.
- Hermes now starts as `hermes -p <profile> acp`; the 0.5.x `hermes -z`
  execution path is removed.
- Daemon `agents` entries are compact ACP launch definitions instead of full
  integration manifests. Built-in IDs cannot be overridden, and each custom
  entry must explicitly require a workspace cwd.
- The deprecated `daemon.claudeCode` configuration and `OPENTAG_CLAUDE_*`
  environment overrides are rejected. Configure built-in launchers through
  their supported local CLI authentication and the Generic ACP options.
- `@opentag/cli`, `@opentag/local-runtime`, and `@opentag/runner` now require
  Node.js 22 or newer.
- Slack final summaries preserve multiline content, are escaped exactly once,
  and are truncated on Unicode code-point boundaries after mrkdwn escaping to
  stay inside a 2500-character platform-safe output budget. Plain-text
  fallbacks no longer re-encode rich callback text.
- The Lark adapter and runnable Lark events app now use
  `@larksuiteoapi/node-sdk ^1.71.1`, whose relaxed Axios range allows patched
  Axios 1.x releases. The workspace lock resolves Axios 1.18.1.

### Security

- ACP `cwd` transport is no longer accepted as proof of workspace isolation.
  The formal ACP execution session that may invoke file tools starts in an
  OpenTag-created worktree for repository Runs or an attempt-scoped scratch
  directory for non-repository Runs. Readiness probes may start earlier in the
  configured repository workspace but do not execute Run file tools.
- Full ACP integration manifests must declare
  `roles.agent.workspace.sessionCwd: "required"`; compact `daemon.agents`
  definitions must declare `workspaceCwd: "required"`. Missing declarations
  fail schema validation instead of becoming unverified runtime claims.
- Built-in ACP children receive a scrubbed environment. Launch overrides reject
  invalid names and credential-like fields or values unconditionally.
  `security.extraSafeEnv` separately allows exact variables inherited from the
  parent process after explicit administrator review.
- OpenClaw cancellation capability fails closed when the runtime cannot prove
  hard cancellation of descendant tool processes.
- Slack source-thread fallbacks keep final summaries human-readable without
  double encoding or bypassing the bounded presentation path.

### Migration: Runner and daemon configuration

- Replace imports of `createCodexExecutor`, `createClaudeCodeExecutor`, and
  `createHermesExecutor` with `builtInAcpAgentDefinitions`,
  `builtInAcpAgentManifests`, or `createBuiltInAcpExecutors` from
  `@opentag/runner`.
- Remove `daemon.claudeCode`. Codex and Claude Code use the pinned ACP launchers
  and their existing local login state; Hermes uses the fixed configured
  profile through `hermes -p <profile> acp`.
- Remove `OPENTAG_CLAUDE_COMMAND`, `OPENTAG_CLAUDE_MODEL`,
  `OPENTAG_CLAUDE_PERMISSION_MODE`, and
  `OPENTAG_CLAUDE_DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_PERMISSIONS`; startup now rejects these
  removed overrides instead of silently ignoring them.
- Rewrite custom `daemon.agents` values as compact launch definitions with
  `command`, optional `args`, and `workspaceCwd: "required"`. Custom agents
  cannot replace the built-in `codex`, `claude-code`, `cursor`, `opencode`,
  `hermes`, or `openclaw` IDs.
- Consumers that call the lower-level `createAcpExecutor` with a complete
  integration manifest must add
  `roles.agent.workspace.sessionCwd: "required"` after verifying that the
  integration's real file tools honor both worktree and scratch cwd.
- Upgrade deployment and development environments to Node.js 22 before
  installing the 0.6.x CLI, Local Runtime, or Runner packages.

## v0.5.0 - 2026-07-14

OpenTag 0.5.0 adds Discord, Linear, and Microsoft Teams adapters and moves
agent execution onto durable, governed Attempts. It is a coordinated release
of all 15 public packages and contains breaking Client and Runner contract
changes described below.

### Added

- Published `@opentag/discord`, `@opentag/linear`, and `@opentag/teams` as
  first-class members of the coordinated package family.
- Discord Gateway and interactions-webhook ingest, channel replies, runtime
  readiness checks, and local-first CLI setup.
- Linear webhook ingest, issue comments, OAuth/API-key setup, workspace
  discovery, issue creation and mutation application, and source-thread action
  receipts.
- Microsoft Teams Bot Framework webhook ingest, tenant-aware authentication,
  channel replies, action application, and CLI/runtime setup.
- A generic stdio ACP host backed by the official ACP SDK. Named ACP agents can
  execute repository Attempts in isolated worktrees or ordinary non-repository
  Attempts in attempt-scoped scratch workspaces.
- Durable Attempt records with monotonically numbered claims, lease recovery,
  opaque fencing tokens, and attempt-scoped cancellation.
- Provider-neutral Channel protocol objects for normalized inbound messages,
  Run Card updates, approval prompts, action receipts, and final summaries.
- Governed ACP permission requests with `allow_once`, `allow_run`, and `deny`
  decisions delivered through the existing source-thread approval path.
- Material Action records for external side effects such as push, deploy,
  publish, and connector writes. Actions now carry stable IDs and idempotency
  keys, store normalized receipts, prevent duplicate execution, and require an
  explicit administrative reconciliation when an outcome remains `unknown`.
- Source-thread runtime controls and richer action receipts across supported
  chat and repository providers, plus local ledger/status evidence for runs,
  Attempts, artifacts, callbacks, and apply outcomes.

### Changed

- Every mutating runner operation now belongs to the active Attempt. Claims
  return `attemptId`, `attemptNumber`, and `fencingToken`; mark-running,
  heartbeat, progress, completion, permission, and material-action receipt
  calls must send the active Attempt lease.
- Lease expiry interrupts the prior Attempt before a new claim is issued. A
  stale worker receives `409 { "error": "stale_attempt" }` and can no longer
  append progress, complete the Run, resolve permissions, or write receipts.
- Agent integrations now use ACP instead of the unshipped
  `opentag.executor.v1` / `stdio-jsonl-basic` protocol. ACP sessions are
  disposable runtime state below durable Runs and Attempts.
- Repository execution uses OpenTag-owned isolation while non-repository ACP
  work uses scratch isolation. Failed, refused, cancelled, and interrupted ACP
  Attempts retain their workspace evidence instead of publishing a commit.
- Source-thread presentation is quieter: routine ACP/tool progress remains in
  audit evidence, while approvals, blockers, material-action receipts, and
  final summaries remain visible to people.
- CLI setup, start, status, doctor, pairing, service, and capability discovery
  now cover the expanded adapter family, ACP agent profiles, runtime readiness,
  secret readiness, and the installed CLI version.
- GitHub and GitLab source threads can run status/doctor/stop controls without
  creating a new Run, and supported source-thread actions reuse the governed
  approval/apply path.

### Security

- Run admission on public GitHub/GitLab repositories now requires
  platform-reported write access by default. GitHub commenters are checked via
  the repository collaborator permission API when the GitHub App path is used;
  GitLab Note Hooks carry no access level, so public GitLab projects stay
  closed until `allowedActors` is configured on the repository binding.
  Private repositories, Slack, and Lark behavior is unchanged, and an explicit
  `allowedActors` list still overrides the default for write-capable runs.
- Source-thread approvals (`apply`, `approve`, ...) from public GitHub/GitLab
  threads follow the same default: without an `allowedActors` list, only
  actors with write access can approve or apply proposed actions.
- The Claude Code executor now matches the Codex executor's protections: it
  runs the pre-execution security assessment, spawns `claude` with a scrubbed
  environment (secrets-like variables are dropped; add auth variables to
  `security.extraSafeEnv` if the CLI authenticates from environment), and
  executes in an isolated git worktree instead of a branch in the main
  checkout.
- Codex runs admitted without a write scope now use the read-only sandbox
  (`--sandbox read-only`) instead of `--full-auto`, so granted permission
  scopes are enforced at the executor level.
- Claude Code runs admitted without `repo:write` now use `--permission-mode
  plan`; repo-write runs default to `acceptEdits` unless a narrower
  `permissionMode` is configured.
- Enabling `dangerouslySkipPermissions` for Claude Code now emits an audit
  warning on every run so the bypass stays visible in the run timeline.
- Fencing tokens are accepted only on authenticated runner mutation requests.
  They are redacted from Attempt records, audit events, callbacks, errors,
  snapshots, logs, and material-action receipts.
- ACP children receive a scrubbed environment, an explicit contained workspace,
  strict NDJSON framing, bounded cancellation, and no dispatcher/channel
  credentials. Child stderr and raw ACP frames do not enter durable Run results
  or source-thread messages.
- Credential-like values, local absolute paths, hidden reasoning, and provider
  secrets are sanitized at progress, completion, receipt, callback, and
  control-plane boundaries.
- Channel roles and ACP agent roles use separate credentials, lifecycle, and
  capability grants; a channel integration cannot silently inherit executor
  authority.
- Attempt lifecycle state and its audit evidence commit atomically so a failed
  evidence write cannot leave a partially advanced lease or terminal Run.

### Migration: Client and custom runners

`@opentag/client` consumers that claim Runs must keep the lease returned by
`claim` and pass it to every mutation:

```ts
import { createOpenTagClient } from "@opentag/client";

const runnerId = "runner_custom";
const client = createOpenTagClient({
  dispatcherUrl: "http://localhost:3030",
  pairingToken: process.env.OPENTAG_PAIRING_TOKEN
});

const claimed = await client.claim({ runnerId });
if (!claimed) throw new Error("No Run available");

const lease = {
  attemptId: claimed.attemptId,
  fencingToken: claimed.fencingToken
};

await client.markRunning({
  runnerId,
  runId: claimed.run.id,
  ...lease,
  executor: "custom"
});
await client.heartbeat({ runnerId, runId: claimed.run.id, ...lease });
await client.progress({
  runnerId,
  runId: claimed.run.id,
  ...lease,
  type: "executor.progress",
  message: "Working on the request"
});
await client.complete({
  runnerId,
  runId: claimed.run.id,
  ...lease,
  result: { conclusion: "success", summary: "Done" }
});
```

- `createDispatcherClient` callers must pass the lease as the new argument to
  `markRunning(runId, executor, lease, options)`, `heartbeat(runId, lease)`,
  `progress(runId, lease, input)`, and
  `complete(runId, lease, result, options)`.
- Direct HTTP runners must use the runner-scoped `/v1/runners/:runnerId/runs/*`
  endpoints and include `attemptId` plus `fencingToken` in every mutation body.
  The old unscoped running/progress/complete endpoints now return `410`.
- Treat `stale_attempt` as loss of ownership: cancel local execution and do not
  retry the mutation with the expired lease. Never log or persist a fencing
  token outside the active runner process.
- Custom `@opentag/runner` adapters must replace `input.workspacePath` with
  `input.workspace.path` (or `executorWorkspacePath(input)`). The workspace is
  now explicitly `{ kind: "repository" | "scratch", path }`, and
  `cancel(runId, attemptId?)` may receive the Attempt to cancel.
- Adapters that execute material side effects should use the injected
  `permissionResolver` before execution and `materialActionReporter` afterward
  so the action remains fenced, receipted, and retry-safe.
- Integrations built on the removed custom stdio protocol must migrate their
  manifest to an ACP agent role and use `createAcpExecutor`.

## v0.3.0 - 2026-06-30

OpenTag 0.3.0 improves the local CLI setup path and makes source-thread
approvals clearer in Slack and GitHub.

### Added

- Slack source-thread action buttons for `apply`, `approve`, `reject`, and
  `continue`
- Slack Events API and Socket Mode handling for interactive Block Kit actions

  action path as typed commands
- Executor summaries avoid presenting source-control handoff steps as manual
  user blockers
- `opentag doctor` catches deprecated Codex model tiers
