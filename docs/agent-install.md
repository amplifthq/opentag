# Agent-Readable OpenTag Install Guide

This guide is written for AI coding agents such as Codex and Claude Code that
are helping a user install and verify OpenTag. Follow the published OpenTag CLI
flow. Do not invent credentials, platform IDs, repository names, local paths, or
secret values.

## Product Boundary

OpenTag is a source-thread action layer for coding agents. The source thread
where work starts remains the human workflow surface for status, safe action
receipts, and audit pointers. OpenTag is not a general chat remote-control
cockpit.

Keep setup and implementation aligned to these OpenTag concepts:

- Project Target: the repository or system of record a source container is
  bound to, such as `github:owner/repo`.
- RunScope: source provider, source thread, and Project Target.
- Readiness: service controller state, runtime health, connector readiness,
  credential verification, executor capability, and action setup.
- Artifacts: run outputs such as patches, reports, screenshots, log summaries,
  and pull request links carried through `OpenTagRunResult.artifacts`.
- Audit: local detail through commands such as `opentag status --run <run_id>`.

Keep external runtime integration on OpenTag-owned APIs and data shapes.
Adapter ingest must use OpenTag's own run lifecycle, idempotency key, terminal
semantics, audit visibility, and runner-scoped authentication.

## Fast Path

1. Confirm Node.js 22 or newer is available:

```bash
node --version
```

2. Check the published package is reachable:

```bash
npm view @opentag/cli version --fetch-timeout=15000
```

3. Install the published CLI, or choose the one-off setup command path:

```bash
npm install -g @opentag/cli@latest
```

For one-off setup without a global install, keep the `npx` prefix on the setup
command:

```bash
npx --yes @opentag/cli setup
```

Prefer the global install when the user wants background service mode, because
the service definition should point at a stable CLI path instead of an `npx`
temporary location. If the user chooses the one-off path, skip the service-mode
commands below unless they later install the CLI globally.

4. For a global install, run setup with the installed binary:

```bash
opentag setup
```

Help the user choose:

- Platform: Slack, GitHub, GitLab, Linear, Lark / Feishu, Telegram, Discord, or Microsoft Teams.
- Coding agent: Codex, Claude Code, or Echo.
- Local project: the intended local checkout.
- Runtime mode: background service when supported, terminal mode otherwise.

5. When setup needs platform credentials, open the matching OpenTag guide and
walk the user through the provider console:

- Slack: `docs/platforms/slack.en.md`
- GitHub: `docs/platforms/github.en.md`
- GitLab: `docs/platforms/gitlab.en.md`
- Linear: `docs/platforms/linear.en.md`
- Lark / Feishu: `docs/platforms/lark.en.md`
- Telegram: `docs/platforms/telegram.en.md`
- Discord: `docs/platforms/discord.en.md`
- Microsoft Teams: `docs/platforms/teams.en.md`

Never ask the user to paste secrets into chat if a local prompt, environment
variable, keychain item, or provider console entry is the safer place to enter
them.

### Microsoft Teams Notes For Agents

Teams setup is more involved than Slack, Discord, or Telegram. Do not improvise
from memory or skip the platform guide. Open `docs/platforms/teams.en.md` and
walk the user through the checklist.

Key points to verify with the user:

- They need a Microsoft 365 tenant with Teams enabled. They do **not** need to
  be a Microsoft 365 Developer Program member, and a personal Gmail/Outlook
  Microsoft account alone is not enough.
- They need permission to upload/install a custom Teams app, or a Teams admin
  who can approve/install it.
- They need an Azure Bot resource, Microsoft App ID, Tenant ID, client secret
  **Value**, and the Microsoft Teams channel enabled on the Azure Bot.
- The Azure Bot Messaging endpoint must be public HTTPS and must end with the
  OpenTag Teams path, usually `https://<tunnel-host>/teams/messages`.
- Teams ingress currently requires local runtime (background service or terminal
  mode); hosted/custom relay mode is not supported.
- For local testing, `ngrok http 3030` is easiest because `http://127.0.0.1:4040`
  shows incoming `POST /teams/messages` requests. If using `devtunnel`, it must
  be started with `devtunnel host -p 3030 --allow-anonymous`.
- Do not ask the user to paste Azure client secrets, Teams app passwords,
  GitHub tokens, or one-time verification codes into the agent chat. Have them
  enter secrets in provider consoles, `opentag setup`, a local environment
  variable, keychain, or local config.
- To bind a Teams channel, prefer the base channel conversation id from
  `channelData.channel.id` / `channelData.teamsChannelId`. Teams thread replies
  may include `;messageid=<root>` in `conversation.id`.
- Read-only smoke tests can use `@OpenTag investigate ...`. Write tests should
  use `@OpenTag fix ...` or `@OpenTag run ...`; otherwise Claude Code may only
  produce a plan.
- `@OpenTag apply 1` requires the channel to be bound to a GitHub/GitLab repo
  and apply credentials to be configured. A local-only repo binding can produce
  a branch/patch but cannot create a pull request from Teams. Historical
  apply/reject actions are rejected if the current Teams channel binding was
  removed or rebound away from the proposal repository.

Common Teams troubleshooting shortcuts:

- If no request reaches OpenTag, check the Azure Bot Messaging endpoint, Teams
  app installation, and whether the user actually mentioned the bot.
- If a devtunnel URL redirects to sign-in, restart it with `--allow-anonymous`.
- If Teams requests return 401, check that the Azure Bot Microsoft App ID matches
  `platforms.teams.appId`, the tenant is correct, and OpenTag is running the
  current Teams adapter.
- If the Claude executor is not ready, run `opentag doctor` and complete the
  normal local Claude login. The Claude ACP adapter is bundled; there is no
  `daemon.claudeCode.command` path to configure.
- If the action receipt says direct apply is not configured, check whether the
  channel binding points at a GitHub/GitLab repository and whether apply tokens
  are configured.

6. Start and verify OpenTag:

```bash
opentag service status
opentag doctor
opentag status
opentag platforms
opentag executors
```

If service mode is unsupported or the user selected terminal mode, run:

```bash
opentag start
```

Keep that terminal open while testing.

## Verification Checklist

Before claiming setup is complete, verify:

- `opentag service status` distinguishes controller state from OpenTag runtime
  readiness.
- `opentag doctor` reports no failing required checks.
- `opentag status` shows redacted secrets, configured repositories, runtime
  mode, capabilities, and agent session profile.
- `opentag platforms` and `opentag executors` expose the support and capability
  matrix from OpenTag's own catalog.
- A source-thread test produces a concise acknowledgement, final summary, and
  local audit pointer instead of streaming internal tool traces into the human
  thread.

## Troubleshooting

If npm metadata is unreachable, inspect npm's current network settings before
changing anything:

```bash
npm config get registry
npm config get proxy
npm config get https-proxy
```

Only use a proxy URL the user provides or one already active in the
environment. Do not permanently change npm config without explicit user
confirmation. Only after npm registry metadata is reachable should you retry:

```bash
npx --yes @opentag/cli --help
```

If service status says the OS controller is running but the runtime is
unreachable or degraded, use:

```bash
opentag service logs
opentag doctor
opentag status
```

Do not treat a healthy LaunchAgent or systemd unit as proof that connectors,
credentials, runner heartbeat, executor capability, or source-thread actions are
ready.
