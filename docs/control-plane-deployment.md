# OpenTag Control Plane deployment runbook

This runbook covers the open-source, single-host Docker Compose profile. It is
also the operational baseline for any managed deployment: the managed service
must run the same OCI image, PostgreSQL schema, migration corpus, and process
commands. This document does not claim that a managed environment is deployed.

## Minimum topology

The reference profile has four application roles and one durable dependency:

| Service | Authority |
| --- | --- |
| `postgres` | All durable Control Plane, identity, audit, and job state |
| `migrate` | One-shot checked-in SQL migration runner |
| `bootstrap-admin` | Idempotent initial owner provisioning |
| `control-plane` | Hono API, operational endpoints, and static console |
| `jobs` | PostgreSQL-leased reconciliation and retention work |

No Cloudflare service, Redis instance, broker, object store, or external
scheduler is required. Compose is a single-host availability profile; it is
not a multi-node high-availability design.

The profile declares the capability envelope `Runner-offline-safe` and the
availability limit `Relay-not-HA`. The first is a required certification target,
not evidence that a particular installation has passed certification or is
active in production. The second remains true for this single-node profile.

## Secrets and configuration

Copy `deploy/compose/.env.example` to an ignored `.env` and replace all
placeholder values. Generate each secret independently. Never commit the
resulting file or pass secrets through a `VITE_` variable.

Required values:

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: database password used only inside the installation;
- `OPENTAG_BOOTSTRAP_PAIRING_TOKEN`: initial runner-pairing authority;
- `OPENTAG_FENCING_TOKEN_SECRET`: independent, at least 32-character authority
  used to derive live fencing tokens. PostgreSQL stores only a
  fencing-token digest, never the live token. Outside `local` the server
  refuses to start when this value equals the bootstrap, recovery, or GitHub
  ingress authority;
- `OPENTAG_LOGIN_THROTTLE_SECRET`: a different, independently generated
  at-least-32-character HMAC authority. Durable throttle rows contain only
  pseudonymous keyed identifiers and are bounded by expiry cleanup;
- `OPENTAG_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `...NAME`, and `...PASSWORD`: initial owner;
- `OPENTAG_PUBLIC_URL`: the exact browser and webhook origin.

Relay content encryption is deliberately not configured with an inline
environment secret. On the host, set only
`OPENTAG_RELAY_CONTENT_KEK_SOURCE_FILE` to a file containing exactly 32 raw
bytes, 64 hexadecimal characters, or base64 that decodes to 32 bytes. On
native Linux, keep the file in a mode-`0700` directory and make the file mode
`0444`, or otherwise grant read access to container UID/GID `10001` without
exposing the parent directory. Compose implements file-backed secrets as bind
mounts and does not remap ownership, so a mode-`0600` file owned by another
host user is unreadable by the non-root image. Compose mounts the file as the
`opentag_relay_content_kek` Docker secret. The container receives only these
immutable references:

```text
OPENTAG_RELAY_CONTENT_KEK_FILE=/run/secrets/opentag_relay_content_kek
OPENTAG_RELAY_CONTENT_KEY_VERSION=v1
```

Never add an inline `OPENTAG_RELAY_CONTENT_KEK` variable. Compose refuses a
missing source file, and the Control Plane key loader rejects malformed or
placeholder file content and keeps relay readiness closed. A copied example
must not be treated as deployable until every placeholder and the KEK path have
been replaced.

The server refuses to start while any secret still carries the unchanged
`replace-with-…` placeholder from `.env.example`, so a copied example file can
never run with publicly known authority values.

Recommended values:

- `OPENTAG_RECOVERY_PAIRING_TOKEN`: separate emergency authority used only to
  reprovision a paired runner credential;
- `OPENTAG_GITHUB_INGRESS_MASTER_SECRET`: at least 32 characters, and only when
  GitHub ingress is intentionally enabled for local testing;
- `OPENTAG_RELEASE_SHA`: the immutable 40-character Git commit for staging or
  production. `local` is accepted only in the local environment.

Login throttling is durable and applies independently to normalized email and
optionally to the direct network peer observed by the Node server:

- `OPENTAG_LOGIN_NETWORK_THROTTLE_MODE`: `direct-peer` by default. Set
  `trusted-edge` only when a verified external edge enforces a client-aware
  login rate limit; that mode disables the application network bucket while
  retaining the email bucket;

- `OPENTAG_LOGIN_MAX_FAILURES`: failures allowed per normalized email in the
  accounting window, default `5`;
- `OPENTAG_LOGIN_NETWORK_MAX_FAILURES`: failures allowed per direct network
  peer across all emails, default `50`. The higher default keeps one shared
  egress address (office NAT, VPN) from becoming a collective lockout after a
  few unrelated typos while still bounding single-source password spraying;
- `OPENTAG_LOGIN_WINDOW_MS`: accounting window, default `300000`;
- `OPENTAG_LOGIN_LOCKOUT_MS`: lockout after the limit is reached, default
  `900000`.

Do not trust arbitrary forwarded-address headers as a login principal. The
application ignores them in both modes. A reverse proxy must either preserve
meaningful direct peer addresses or use `trusted-edge` with independently
verified client-aware rate limiting; leaving `direct-peer` enabled behind a
single shared proxy can turn that proxy into a site-wide lockout bucket.

Runtime and API-key tokens are one-time material. Store them in the runner or
operator secret store when issued. A live hosted-claim fencing token is derived
from the deployment secret and the immutable claim tuple. The database retains
only credential hashes and the fencing-token digest, so replay can reconstruct
the same response without making the token recoverable from a database dump.

## TLS and public ingress

Do not expose the plain HTTP Compose port directly to the Internet. Terminate
TLS in a reverse proxy or load balancer and set `OPENTAG_PUBLIC_URL` to that
exact HTTPS origin. Forward the original `Host` and scheme consistently.

GitHub ingress is absent unless its master secret is configured and a binding
has been created. The current open-source foundation does not yet implement
audited binding-secret rotation or disable/re-enable recovery. Keep the master
secret empty and do not register a production provider webhook until that
lifecycle exists and has incident-recovery evidence. Local disposable tests
may enable it to verify signature, delivery reservation, replay, and admission.
Accepted webhook delivery means the intent was durably admitted; it does not
mean execution began or a provider mutation completed.

Cloudflare DNS/CDN/WAF may proxy the origin, but it is optional. Do not cache
Control V1, console API, authentication, or provider-ingress responses.

## Installation and upgrade

Pin a reviewed image digest in production. For the local source profile:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env build
docker image inspect opentag-control-plane:local --format '{{.Id}}'
docker compose --env-file .env up -d
docker compose --env-file .env ps
```

Before starting it, complete and record this secret-free binding checklist:

- Slack installation identity and installation credential **Secret Reference**;
- paired Runner identity, credential generation, and expected relay origin;
- GitHub Project Target binding (owner/repository identity, never a token);
- named ACP executor declaration and its workspace/isolation policy.

Do not paste Slack, Runner, GitHub, or executor credentials into this document,
Compose environment values, command history, or binding records. Store only
secret references where the relevant installation or Runner contract calls for
them.

Startup is ordered by health and completion: PostgreSQL, migration, bootstrap,
HTTP readiness, then jobs. Migrations take a PostgreSQL advisory lock, verify
the checksum of every already-applied file, and only append new migrations.
Never edit a migration after it has been released.

Before upgrading an existing installation, stop both `control-plane` and
`jobs`; leaving the old jobs process active can retain a live legacy projection
lease, and migration `0021` deliberately refuses to guess whether that work is
still executing. An expired projection lease is safely returned to pending and
converted to the v2 job shape. A live lease remains a hard stop until the old
worker exits or the operator has separately proved it dead.

The first upgrade from the pre-relay schema is intentionally outcome
preserving, not work preserving. Migration `0007` terminates legacy in-flight
Hosted Attempts as `interrupted/outcome_unknown`, and `0009` consumes legacy
Slack action authorities whose exact Attempt/fence lineage cannot be proven.
Drain work before upgrading when possible. Afterward, reconcile ambiguous
material/provider effects and issue fresh controls; never replay them blindly.

For an upgrade:

1. Back up the complete recovery set—PostgreSQL plus the exact relay-content
   KEK file and immutable key version `v1`—and verify both artifacts are readable.
2. Pull or build the exact reviewed image digest.
3. Stop the old HTTP and jobs roles: `docker compose stop control-plane jobs`.
4. Run `docker compose run --rm migrate` and wait for successful completion.
5. Start HTTP and jobs on the same image digest with `docker compose up -d`.
6. Verify `/readyz`, capability discovery, console login, runner readiness,
   and a non-destructive hosted lifecycle smoke.
7. Retain the prior image until rollback compatibility is understood.

A database migration may make application rollback unsafe. Rollback is an
explicit release decision, not an automatic response to a failed healthcheck.

## PostgreSQL sizing and connections

`OPENTAG_DB_POOL_MAX` is per process. The total possible connections are:

```text
(HTTP replica count + jobs replica count) * OPENTAG_DB_POOL_MAX
+ migration/bootstrap headroom
+ operator and monitoring headroom
```

Keep that total below the server or provider connection limit. Start with the
default of 10 only when the installation can afford it; small installations
can use a lower value. Monitor pool wait time, long transactions, locks, job
lease age, database storage, and backup age.

The HTTP process stops accepting new requests on `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT`, drains
the server, and closes the pool. The jobs process aborts its poll loop, releases
resources, and closes the pool. Give both roles a termination grace period
longer than normal request/transaction duration.

## Backup and restore rehearsal

PostgreSQL data, the exact relay-content KEK file, and immutable key version
`v1` are one indivisible recovery set. Losing the database loses canonical
authority and ciphertext state. Losing the KEK makes all retained ciphertext
unrecoverable. A database dump paired with a different KEK or version is not a
recovery. Protect the database dump and KEK backup separately while preserving
their explicit recovery-set association.

Back up PostgreSQL with normal tooling. A custom-format example:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env exec -T postgres \
  pg_dump -U opentag -d opentag --format=custom > opentag-control-plane.dump
```

Restore into a new database or disposable installation, not over the only
copy:

```bash
createdb opentag_restore
pg_restore --exit-on-error --no-owner --dbname=opentag_restore \
  opentag-control-plane.dump
```

After restore, point the same application image at the restored database and
mount the exact recovery-set KEK at `/run/secrets/opentag_relay_content_kek`
with `OPENTAG_RELAY_CONTENT_KEY_VERSION=v1`. Verify migrations, `/readyz`,
tenant counts, runner registrations, hosted run terminal states, permission
receipts, material-action receipts, retained relay-content decryption, jobs,
and audit records. A backup without a successful restore rehearsal is not
recovery evidence.

Do not rotate or replace the KEK, and do not change its key version, without an
explicit migration that rewraps or migrates every retained encrypted object and
proves crash-safe resume. This reference profile supplies no such rotation
migration; ad hoc replacement makes retained ciphertext unrecoverable.

## Credential recovery and re-pairing

If runtime credential material is lost, call the credential-reprovision route
with the separately stored recovery token. Successful reprovisioning increments
the credential generation, revokes the prior credential, and returns new
material once. Confirm that the old credential receives `401` before relying
on the recovery result.

If the recovery token is unavailable or compromised, rotate installation
secrets under an incident plan and re-pair affected runners. Do not attempt to
recover plaintext credential material from PostgreSQL; it is intentionally not
stored.

## Verification and truthful limits

Before production use, require:

- exact image digest and source revision;
- clean empty-volume installation;
- upgrade from the previous migration corpus;
- backup and restore rehearsal;
- runner pair/re-pair and credential revocation;
- concurrent claim/fencing and cancellation race tests;
- permission and material-receipt tests;
- provider signature, replay, and tenant-mismatch negatives;
- audited provider-binding secret rotation and disable/re-enable recovery;
- graceful shutdown and connection-budget checks.

Only after these checks pass for the exact deployment identity may status report
`Runner-offline-safe` for that installation. It must continue to report
`Relay-not-HA`; neither a successful check nor a healthy process turns this
single-node Compose topology into HA or proves production activation.

The repository proves the local Compose profile only after those checks are
run against the exact image. A managed deployment, multi-replica behavior,
DNS, TLS, provider registration, or production activation requires separate
environment evidence and authorization.
