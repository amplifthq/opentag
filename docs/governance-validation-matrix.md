# Governance Validation Matrix

Use this matrix when you need to prove OpenTag's governed source-thread loop is
not only a happy-path demo. It groups repeatable tests around failure
boundaries, source-thread controls, recovery behavior, artifact quality, replay
parity, completion governance, governed WorkLoop actions, and privacy redaction.

Run every local matrix case:

```bash
corepack pnpm smoke:governance -- --all --report .omx/governance-matrix/all.json
```

Each case stores an explicit executable plus argument vector. The harness passes
that vector directly to the child process without shell parsing, and JSON reports
preserve the same structured command.

List available cases:

```bash
corepack pnpm smoke:governance -- --list
```

## Cases

| Case | What It Proves |
| --- | --- |
| `permission-boundaries` | Token and permission failures remain explicit; public repos are denied by default without write access; `allowedActors` can allow or deny; bot permission failures are surfaced; daemon Project Target allowlists block unsafe runs. |
| `source-thread-controls` | GitHub, GitLab, Slack, and Lark action replies reach `submitThreadAction`; `apply 1`, `reject 1`, `continue 1`, and `stop` have durable effects; duplicate and concurrent action replies are idempotent. |
| `recovery-idempotency` | Runner leases, duplicate source deliveries, lifecycle idempotency keys, delivery-intent dedupe, fenced settlement, heartbeats, timeout cancellation, and status evidence survive failure or retry paths. |
| `artifact-ledger-quality` | `opentag status --run <run_id>` remains useful after live-shaped runs: artifacts, Agent Work Ledger, queued delivery intents, activation blocks, and apply outcome metrics are visible while source-thread receipts stay concise. Provider delivery outcomes come only from the delivery journal or signed provider observations. |
| `apply-failure-ux` | Retired automatic-PR compatibility has no git/provider side effects; exact publication preserves operation identity and reconciles ambiguous provider outcomes before retry; supported direct-apply failures remain explicit and do not leak credentials. |
| `replay-parity` | GitHub, Slack, GitLab, and Lark live-shaped fixtures replay in memory with the same receipt, artifact, ledger, delivery-intent, and executor-capability strategy. |
| `completion-governance` | One sanitized GitHub fixture proves admission, Context Packet generation, durable WorkThread identity, fencing, executor success pending verification, current-head checks, merge, superseding assessment lineage, concise source-thread projection, CLI explanation, restart recovery, and the end-to-end completion metric. |
| `work-loop-actions` | Completion gates, human escalations, material-action receipts, and run outcomes produce structured causes and ActionHint primitives; WorkThread status and bounded attention expose one canonical WorkLoop view; the golden loop moves from evidence refresh to no action. |
| `privacy-redaction` | Replay fixtures, public governance documentation, installed public-package manifests/README files during `release:check`, and existing `.omx/live-e2e` and `.omx/governance-matrix` reports are scanned for token-like values, private keys, webhook secrets, Slack bot tokens, GitHub/GitLab tokens, full Lark message IDs, and local absolute paths. |

Run the privacy scan directly when reviewing live artifacts:

```bash
corepack pnpm smoke:privacy -- \
  --allow-missing \
  --path packages/dispatcher/test/fixtures/replay \
  --path docs/governance-validation-matrix.md \
  --path docs/replay-harness.md \
  --path docs/npm-release.md \
  --path .omx/live-e2e \
  --path .omx/governance-matrix
```

The scan never reads secret files such as local token files. It only scans
visible callback/report/status/artifact evidence and redacts matched excerpts in
its own output.

## Live-Derived Replay Fixtures

`replay-parity` includes sanitized GitHub, Slack, GitLab, and Lark fixtures.
These fixtures should preserve the live run shape, not the raw provider payload:

- replace real repositories, user IDs, chat IDs, message IDs, and project IDs
  with reviewable placeholders;
- keep action receipts, artifact types, ledger categories, and callback
  expectations realistic;
- never copy provider tokens, webhook secrets, private keys, raw API response
  bodies, local checkout paths, or full Lark/Slack message identifiers into the
  fixture.

`completion-governance` adds a stricter GitHub golden loop in
`packages/dispatcher/test/fixtures/replay/github-completion-governance.json`.
It deliberately keeps the executor result separate from authoritative GitHub
evidence: process success first produces a pending assessment, then a sanitized
current-head snapshot for required checks and merge produces a new satisfied
assessment. The pending view must name `refresh_completion_evidence` and its
gate causes; the satisfied view must end at `none` with no residual causes.
Replaying that same delivery must not append another assessment or source-thread
callback.

## Boundary

This harness is intentionally local and repeatable. It does not hit live
GitHub, Slack, Lark, or GitLab APIs. Use `smoke:live` plus the provider-specific
live scripts when you need fresh external-provider evidence.

The completion fixture is live-shaped, not live provider proof. Release or PR
readiness that claims a real GitHub completion loop still requires a configured
test repository, signed webhook delivery, GitHub API reconciliation of the
current PR head, required checks, and merge. When those credentials and that
external fixture are unavailable, keep the PR draft and name the missing live
proof explicitly.

The matrix is still valuable before a live pass because it exercises the exact
dispatcher, adapter, store, delivery-kernel, and daemon contracts used after
ingestion. After a live pass, rerun `privacy-redaction` and promote only
sanitized evidence into replay fixtures.
