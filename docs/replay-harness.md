# OpenTag Replay Harness

OpenTag's replay harness keeps the product from drifting back into a plain connector. A replay fixture captures a source-thread event, the expected executor result, and the governed-loop evidence that must appear after dispatch.

Use replay fixtures for source-thread behavior that should stay stable:

- admission and duplicate handling;
- context packet snapshot generation;
- executor capability ledger entries;
- artifact-first final results;
- source-thread action receipt shape;
- callback delivery without internal process noise;
- agent work ledger categories;
- completion governance from executor success through provider-verified
  current-head checks and merge.

## Fixture Location

Dispatcher replay fixtures live under:

```text
packages/dispatcher/test/fixtures/replay/
```

Each fixture is JSON so it can be reviewed independently from test code. A fixture contains:

- `runId`: stable run identifier for the replay.
- `event`: an `OpenTagEvent` source-thread event.
- `executorCapability`: the capability snapshot the runner reports at `running`.
- `result`: an `OpenTagRunResult` with artifacts and optional suggested actions.
- `expected`: compact assertions for artifact types, ledger categories, and final callback text.

The strict GitHub completion fixture also carries a sanitized
`completionPolicy` and `verifiedSnapshot`. These are test inputs for the local
governance boundary, not raw webhook payloads or a claim that the test contacted
GitHub.

## Add A Replay Case

1. Add a new JSON file in `packages/dispatcher/test/fixtures/replay/`.
2. Use a realistic source-thread event from GitHub, Slack, GitLab, Lark / Feishu, or another adapter.
3. If the case came from a live run, preserve the live shape but sanitize it before committing:
   replace real repository names, user IDs, project IDs, chat IDs, message IDs,
   and branch suffixes with reviewable placeholders.
4. Keep secrets and live provider IDs out of the fixture.
5. Do not copy raw provider API responses, webhook headers, local absolute
   checkout paths, executor stdout/stderr, full Lark message IDs, or Slack bot
   tokens into the fixture.
6. Include at least one machine-addressable artifact with `id`, `type`, `title`, `uri`, and `summary`.
7. Add ordinary source-thread fixtures to
   `packages/dispatcher/test/replay-harness.test.ts`. Add strict completion
   fixtures to a dedicated test that keeps executor output and provider evidence
   as separate lifecycle steps.
8. Run:

```bash
corepack pnpm vitest run packages/dispatcher/test/replay-harness.test.ts
corepack pnpm vitest run packages/dispatcher/test/completion-governance-replay.test.ts
```

Replay tests should not call live provider APIs. They exercise the dispatcher app in memory and prove that OpenTag still produces a bounded context packet, an executor capability snapshot, artifacts, callbacks, and a ledger view for the source thread.

The strict completion replay additionally proves a durable WorkThread,
attempt-fencing rejection, pending completion after process success,
provider-verified evidence on one current PR head, superseding assessment
lineage, a single end-to-end completion metric, restart recovery, and concise
CLI/source-thread explanations. A real provider proof remains a separate live
gate with configured credentials, signed ingress, and API reconciliation.

## Product Boundary

Replay fixtures should reinforce OpenTag's boundary:

- The source thread remains the human workflow surface.
- The local runner remains the execution boundary.
- The agent work ledger is the durable audit surface.
- Final callbacks compress the outcome and point to artifacts/status.
- OpenTag does not become a new AI workspace or a stream of internal agent logs.
